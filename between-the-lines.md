## Scholarly Interests: Listening to the Margins

### The Sound of Survival

My scholarly work centers on the intersections of sound studies, queer theory, and writing pedagogy—areas that might seem disparate but are deeply connected by questions of voice, power, and survival. My most sustained publishing has been with *Sounding Out!*, the premier sound studies blog, where I've explored how marginalized communities use sound to navigate trauma, claim space, and resist erasure.

### Queer Sound and the AIDS Epidemic

My personal scholarly investment lies in examining queer sound, trauma, and the ongoing reverberations of the AIDS crisis. This work investigates how queer communities have used sonic practices—from the silence of mourning to the defiant noise of activism—as tools of survival and resistance. The AIDS epidemic didn't just devastate a generation; it created sonic absences, gaps in the cultural record where voices should have been.

My work traces how these sonic traces of trauma continue to shape queer experience and cultural memory. When someone's voice is silenced by death, by stigma, by institutional neglect, what sounds remain? How do communities preserve and transmit knowledge when traditional forms of documentation fail them? These questions drive my research into the sonic dimensions of queer history and the ways sound carries embodied knowledge that writing alone cannot capture.

### From Sonic Margins to Classroom Voice

The connection between composition/rhetoric and sound studies is inextricable—voice, rhythm, resonance, the embodied experience of language, the sonic dimensions of persuasion. Yet this obvious interdisciplinary connection was not recognized by my institution in Arkansas, reflecting the kind of disciplinary siloing that prevents innovative scholarship and marginalizes work that challenges traditional academic boundaries.

This focus on marginalized sonic experiences directly informs my pedagogical approach. Just as queer communities have had to find alternative ways to preserve and transmit knowledge, many of my students come from backgrounds where their voices have been systematically devalued by educational institutions. The skills I've developed listening for the subtle ways marginalized communities encode survival strategies in sound translate directly to my ability to hear and validate the diverse ways students bring knowledge into the classroom.

When I teach writing, I'm teaching students to find and trust their voices in academic discourse—much like queer communities have had to find ways to make themselves heard despite institutional silence. The sonic metaphor isn't accidental: writing is about rhythm, resonance, and the particular frequency of an individual mind engaging with complex ideas.

### Sound Studies and Embodied Knowledge

My work in sound studies emphasizes embodied knowledge—the understanding that comes through lived experience rather than abstract theorizing. Sound is always embodied; it moves through bodies, affects bodies, connects bodies across space and time. This understanding shapes how I approach student learning, recognizing that students bring embodied knowledge from their own experiences that must be honored and integrated rather than replaced by academic discourse.

The "Live Through This: Sonic Affect, Queerness, and the Trembling Body" piece I published in *Sounding Out!* explores how trauma registers in the body and how sound can both trigger and heal. This work on sonic affect directly influences my understanding of how students experience the vulnerability of learning, especially when they're being asked to take intellectual risks or challenge their existing worldviews.

### Editorial Work and Community Building

As Editor-at-large for *Sounding Out!* from 2017-2023, I helped shape conversations around sound, identity, and social justice. This editorial work taught me about building inclusive scholarly communities—creating platforms where emerging voices could contribute to important conversations alongside established scholars. These skills translated directly to my program development work, where I built writing support systems that created pathways for diverse students to enter and succeed in academic discourse.

The special series I've co-edited on "Sound and Affect" brought together scholars working at the intersections of sound studies, queer theory, disability studies, and critical race theory. This interdisciplinary collaboration mirrors my approach to writing program administration, where I've consistently worked across departments and disciplines to create more inclusive and effective educational experiences.

### Research as Personal and Political Act

My scholarly interests aren't purely academic—they emerge from lived experience and political commitment. As someone who came of age during the ongoing AIDS crisis, who has navigated academic spaces as a queer scholar, and who has experienced chronic pain and systemic medical neglect, I understand how institutions can silence voices and erase experiences.

This personal investment drives my commitment to rigorous scholarship that refuses to abstract human experience into pure theory. Whether I'm writing about the sonic dimensions of mourning in queer communities or developing writing curricula that honor student voices, the work is always about making space for experiences and ways of knowing that have been marginalized or ignored.

### Current and Future Directions

My book manuscript examines how neoliberal pressures on higher education echo the institutional neglect that allowed the AIDS crisis to devastate queer communities. Both represent failures of care, moments when institutions prioritized efficiency and profit over human flourishing. This connection isn't metaphorical—it's structural, revealing how power operates to determine whose voices matter and whose experiences deserve attention.

Moving forward, I'm particularly interested in how AI and digital technologies might either amplify or further silence marginalized voices. Just as the AIDS epidemic created sonic absences that continue to shape cultural memory, I'm concerned about what voices might be lost or distorted as educational institutions embrace technological solutions without considering their impact on the communities they claim to serve.

### The Integration

My work in sound studies, my commitment to inclusive pedagogy, and my resistance to educational commodification all stem from the same source: understanding what it means to be marginalized and the importance of creating spaces where all voices can be heard. Sound studies teaches us that listening is a skill, that attention is a form of care, and that the voices pushed to the margins often have the most important things to say.

This is the scholarly foundation that grounds all my educational work: the conviction that everyone has something vital to contribute, and that our job as educators is to create the conditions where those contributions can be heard, valued, and preserved for future generations.
