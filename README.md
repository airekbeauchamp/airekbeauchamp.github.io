## Transformative Education | Sound Studies | Writing as Liberation

I teach because I know what it feels like to be written off, and I know what it feels like to be seen and believed in. From growing up in poverty with no roadmap for my intelligence to becoming a scholar whose work spans writing studies, sound studies, and queer theory, my journey has taught me that education is fundamentally about human transformation‚Äînot information transfer.

### What I Do
As an educator and researcher, I create programs and pedagogies that meet students where they are while challenging them to think more deeply. My work has secured **$365,668 in grants** (including a $350,000 NSF grant), grown online writing programs by **300% in their first year**, and consistently focused on one principle: every student who walks into a classroom is looking for tools to transform their circumstances.

My scholarly work examines the intersections of **sound studies, queer theory, and writing pedagogy**‚Äîexploring how marginalized communities use voice and sound to navigate trauma, claim space, and resist erasure. As Editor-at-large for *Sounding Out!* (2017-2023), I've helped shape conversations around sound, identity, and social justice while building inclusive academic communities. I'm currently completing a book manuscript that critiques neoliberal influences on higher education while proposing actionable alternatives.

### Why It Matters
In a moment when critical thinking is under attack and students are treated as consumers rather than scholars, I maintain that teaching writing is teaching thinking, and teaching thinking is teaching liberation. Whether developing ESL support systems, creating writing programs for first-generation college students, or examining how institutions silence marginalized voices, my work resists the commodification of education and prioritizes human flourishing over efficiency metrics.

*"Teaching writing is teaching thinking. Teaching thinking is teaching liberation. And teaching liberation is the most important work I can imagine doing."*
