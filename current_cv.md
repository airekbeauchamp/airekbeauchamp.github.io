## PROFESSIONAL STATEMENT

An interdisciplinary scholar-educator with expertise in writing studies, sound studies, and queer theory, I bring seven years of proven innovation in higher education pedagogy and program development. My career has been defined by building transformative writing support systems that serve diverse student populations—from first-generation college students to international ESL learners to STEM doctoral candidates.

As Assistant Professor and Director of Writing Support Innovations at Arkansas State University (2016-2023), I secured $365,668 in grant funding, including a $350,000 NSF grant for Writing for STEM initiatives. I established and scaled an online writing center that achieved 300% growth in its first year while creating embedded disciplinary support programs across multiple colleges. My pedagogical approach integrates critical theory with practical innovation, developing assessment frameworks that honor student diversity while maintaining academic rigor.

My research examines the intersections of writing pedagogy, institutional power structures, and student agency. Currently completing a book manuscript that critiques neoliberal influences on higher education while proposing actionable alternatives, I am particularly interested in ethical applications of AI and emerging technologies in the writing classroom. My publications in sound studies explore how marginalized voices navigate academic spaces through sonic affect and embodied knowledge.

I seek opportunities at comprehensive universities that value teaching excellence, interdisciplinary collaboration, and student-centered innovation. I am particularly interested in contributing to institutions committed to reimagining higher education as a space for critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and inclusive excellence—particularly as universities navigate the evolving landscape of AI and digital literacy.
