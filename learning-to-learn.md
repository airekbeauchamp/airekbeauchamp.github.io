# Learning to Learn
## Teaching Philosophy & Commitment to Student Learning

### Writing as Liberation: Fostering Critical Thinking in the Contemporary Classroom

Teaching writing is teaching thinking. In my fifteen years as an educator, this fundamental principle has guided every curriculum I've developed, every student conference I've held, and every program I've built. I believe that when we teach students to write with intention, complexity, and their own authentic voices, we give them tools not just for academic success, but for navigating and transforming the world around them.

### Student-Centered Pedagogy in Practice

My pedagogical approach is deeply rooted in liberatory education principles, drawing particularly from Paolo Freire's critical pedagogy and bell hooks' transformative teaching. Rather than positioning myself as the sole authority dispensing knowledge, I create classroom environments where students are co-investigators in their own learning. This means:

**Honoring Student Experience:** I begin each semester not with my syllabus, but with understanding who my students are, what they bring to the classroom, and what they hope to achieve. Whether working with first-generation college students navigating academic discourse for the first time, international ESL learners bridging linguistic and cultural differences, or STEM doctoral candidates learning to communicate complex research, I meet students where they are.

**Embracing Original Thinking:** While many students arrive in my classroom having been taught to avoid the first person and original thought, I explicitly invite them back into their own writing. Real writing requires real thinking, and real thinking requires the courage to engage personally with ideas, to synthesize sources with one's own insights, and to take intellectual risks.

**Creating Supportive Challenge:** My students know that I will ask them to write substantive papers—often 5-6 pages when they're used to much shorter assignments—because I believe they are capable of sustained, complex thought. But I also provide the scaffolding, feedback, and support systems they need to meet these challenges successfully.

### Innovation in Service of Learning

My commitment to student success has driven me to develop innovative programs that address real needs rather than chasing technological trends for their own sake. As Director of Writing Support Innovations at Arkansas State University, I:

**Scaled meaningful support:** Growing our online writing center by 300% in its first year by focusing on accessibility and disciplinary integration rather than flashy technology

**Created embedded support:** Developing tutoring programs that met students in their own disciplinary contexts, working with multiple graduate departments to provide specialized writing support

**Secured substantial funding:** Obtaining $365,668 in grants, including a $350,000 NSF grant for Writing for STEM initiatives, because I could demonstrate concrete learning outcomes and student success metrics

These programs succeeded because they were built on pedagogical principles, not technological promises. They addressed real student needs with human connection and disciplinary expertise.

### Theoretical Grounding, Practical Impact

My teaching is informed by sophisticated theoretical frameworks—from Foucault's analysis of power structures in education to Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy of becoming—but these theories matter only insofar as they help me better serve my students. Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) helps me understand students as complex individuals shaped by their social, cultural, and historical contexts. This means designing curriculum that acknowledges the full humanity of learners rather than treating them as empty vessels to be filled with predetermined content.

When I teach first-year composition, I'm not just teaching the five-paragraph essay. I'm teaching students to see themselves as thinkers capable of original insight, as researchers who can engage meaningfully with complex sources, and as writers whose voices matter in academic and public discourse.

### Resistance to Educational Commodification

My approach to teaching is intentionally resistant to the neoliberal commodification of higher education. While institutional pressures push toward standardization, assessment metrics that reduce learning to easily measurable outcomes, and technological interventions that prioritize efficiency over effectiveness, I maintain that education is fundamentally about human transformation.

This means:

**Prioritizing process over product:** While final papers matter, the thinking, drafting, revising, and reflecting that lead to those papers matter more

**Valuing diverse forms of knowledge:** Recognizing that students bring important insights from their lived experiences, cultural backgrounds, and community knowledge

**Maintaining high expectations with high support:** Refusing to lower standards while providing the scaffolding students need to meet them

### Commitment to Inclusive Excellence

Having worked extensively with diverse student populations—from developmental writers to doctoral candidates, from traditional college-age students to adult learners returning to education—I understand that effective pedagogy must be inclusive pedagogy. This doesn't mean lowering expectations; it means designing multiple pathways to success and recognizing that students' diverse backgrounds are assets, not deficits.

My work developing comprehensive ESL support systems and creating writing programs that serve first-generation college students reflects my belief that higher education should be a site of liberation and empowerment for all students, not just those who arrive already fluent in academic discourse.

### Teaching as Political and Personal Act

I cannot separate my teaching from my values. In a cultural moment when critical thinking is under attack, when students are increasingly taught to see themselves as consumers rather than scholars, and when educational institutions prioritize profit over purpose, teaching writing as thinking becomes a deeply political act.

By inviting students to engage their own voices, to think critically about the world around them, and to see themselves as capable of contributing to important conversations, I'm preparing them not just for academic success but for engaged citizenship. The writing classroom becomes a space where students develop the tools they need to resist intellectual complacency and contribute meaningfully to democratic discourse.

### Looking Forward: Education for Uncertain Times

As I return to academic life and seek new opportunities to contribute to student learning, I'm particularly interested in how we can maintain our commitment to transformative education while navigating new challenges—from AI and digital literacy to increasing political pressures on higher education.

My book manuscript, currently under review, examines these tensions while proposing concrete alternatives to the market-driven approaches that are hollowing out higher education. But my real work happens in the classroom, in individual conferences with students, in the moment when a learner discovers they have something important to say and the tools to say it effectively.

This is why I teach: not to fill seats or meet enrollment targets, but to participate in the ongoing work of human transformation, one student, one conversation, one carefully crafted sentence at a time.

*This teaching philosophy reflects my commitment to pedagogical practices that honor student agency, foster critical thinking, and resist the commodification of learning. It is grounded in both theoretical sophistication and practical classroom experience, developed over fifteen years of teaching and program administration in higher education.*
