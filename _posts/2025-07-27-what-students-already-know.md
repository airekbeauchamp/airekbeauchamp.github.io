# What Students Already Know
## What it means to really flip a classroom

Earlier this week, I shared three moments that revealed how academic "excellence" often functions as sophisticated gatekeeping—dismissing passionate scholarship as "fangirling," using inclusive language to perform exclusion, and defending impenetrable theory as intellectual rigor. These were anecdotal glimpses among the many ways we casually enact oppressive power in higher education, but to me they stood out. For some reason they were etched not just into my mind, but they still, some a decade later, crawl across my skin.

So what if we took steps to alter our practices as educators, beginning with adopting the mindset, the knowledge, that students possess remarkable analytical sophistication that academic institutions consistently fail to recognize. Instead of acknowledging this intelligence, we've created educational systems that require students to suppress their existing capabilities while learning to perform narrow versions of academic acceptability. This isn't a new insight—every generation of educators seems to rediscover that students know more than we give them credit for. But the reminder feels urgent right now, as institutional gatekeeping becomes increasingly sophisticated in its exclusions.

## Call for Papers/Call to Arms

In 2019, something extraordinary happened in the staid world of academic conferences. Vershawn Ashanti Young, serving as program chair for the Conference on College Composition and Communication, issued a call for proposals unlike anything the field had seen:

*We gon show up, show out, practice, and theorize performance-rhetoric and performance-composition. Ahm talkin bout buttressing the public good and engaging communication pedagogies that open possibilities.*

Young's call deliberately mixed African American Vernacular English with academic discourse, creating what he calls "code-meshing", a strategic blending of home languages with institutional requirements. The response from the academic community was swift and telling. Some celebrated the innovation; others were furious. The controversy revealed deep anxieties about whose voices belong in academic spaces and what "professional" communication should sound like.

But Young demonstrated that sophisticated academic thinking doesn't require abandoning your authentic voice. His code-meshing wasn't sloppiness or unprofessionalism—it was strategic rhetorical choice-making that challenged artificial boundaries between "proper" academic discourse and other forms of intelligence. To the furious in the replies, Young's call somehow set back or diminished the field. I argue, as Young well knew, that his call enriched the field. It empowered the field.

The controversy also revealed something crucial about student experience. Every semester, students navigate similar linguistic negotiations, code-switching between home communities and academic spaces, translating their sophisticated insights into discourse that sometimes feels foreign and often actually is hostile to their ways of knowing.

## Knowing Our Angles

Young's work points to a broader shift in how intelligence operates in contemporary culture. For decades, I've been haunted by Joan Didion's observation: "Many people know about camera angles now, but not so many know about sentences." When she wrote this, she was trapped within a cultural hierarchy that positioned visual and textual communication as separate competencies requiring different kinds of intelligence.

But something profound has shifted since then. Camera angles have become a kind of unconscious grammar that informs how we make meaning. Students navigate visual rhetoric with remarkable sophistication—understanding how close-ups create intimacy, how lighting shapes mood, how camera position constructs power relations. They deploy these insights daily across social media platforms, creating content that demonstrates complex understanding of audience, purpose, and rhetorical effect.

The same students who struggle with "proper" essay format might create compelling TikTok narratives that compress social critique into fifteen-second visual arguments. They understand how to build audience engagement, create narrative tension, and deliver effective conclusions—but this expertise often goes unrecognized in academic contexts that privilege narrow textual conventions over multimodal intelligence.

What if we recognized that students already possess sophisticated grammatical knowledge across multiple modes of communication? What if instead of treating their digital literacy as distraction from "real" learning, we understood it as evidence of analytical capabilities that could enhance rather than threaten academic work?

## Invisible Sophistication

Students arrive in our classrooms as expert social grammarians. They shift seamlessly between different communicative contexts—professional emails, family group texts, Instagram stories, academic discussions. They demonstrate an intuitive understanding of audience expectations, genre conventions, and appropriate voice choices.

They possess what I call **"survival intelligence"**—sophisticated pattern recognition developed through navigating environments where misreading social and rhetorical cues has material consequences. Students who've learned to detect microaggressions in academic settings become expert analyzers of subtle rhetorical violence, developing capabilities for reading power dynamics that formal training rarely provides.

Consider the student who describes a corporate diversity advertisement as creating **"tokenism exhaustion."** They're performing complex intersectional analysis, recognizing how representational choices can simultaneously acknowledge and contain difference. Their affective vocabulary captures rhetorical complexity that traditional academic language struggles to describe with equivalent precision.

Or the student who immediately recognizes when academic discussions about "diversity" shift into what they call **"deficit discourse"**—language that frames difference as a problem to be managed rather than a resource to be valued. Their rapid pattern recognition draws on years of experience navigating institutional contexts where such discourse shifts signal immediate threats to their academic belonging.

These students don't lack analytical capabilities. They demonstrate forms of intelligence that academic institutions consistently fail to recognize because they don't match narrow ideas about what legitimate analysis looks like. They don't impoverish the field in which English for Academic Purposes makes meaning. They enrich it.

## They Been Knew

Young's controversial CFP revealed something crucial. Students who navigate multiple discourse communities develop sophisticated understanding of how meaning shifts across contexts, audiences, and cultural frameworks. When they describe the exhaustion of constant code-meshing, they're analyzing the rhetorical labor required to navigate different communication systems that operate according to different rules and assumptions. Those who approach student communication from the deficit standpoint often lack the ability to empathize, but they also often fail to move outside of EAP or its adjacent dialects.

This translational intelligence manifests in remarkable analytical insights. Students understand how certain vocabulary choices will be interpreted differently by family members versus professors, how cultural references resonate with peer communities but confuse academic audiences, how emotional registers affect credibility within institutional contexts.

But this sophisticated rhetorical awareness often gets dismissed as "unprofessional" or "inappropriate for academic discourse." Students learn to suppress their most powerful analytical tools in favor of generic academic voice that strips away the very cultural knowledge that makes their insights distinctive.

What if we recognized code-meshing as intellectual sophistication rather than academic deficiency? What if we understood that students who can navigate multiple discourse communities possess exactly the kind of rhetorical intelligence that academic work requires—the ability to analyze audience, adapt purpose, and make strategic communicative choices?

## Beyond Error Correction

Traditional approaches to student writing focus on surface-level corrections—fixing "errors" in grammar, citation format, and organizational structure. But this focus on mechanical compliance misses the sophisticated thinking behind student work.

When a student writes "My mama, she always told me..." they're not making an error—they're deploying African American Vernacular English emphasis patterns that create intimacy and rhetorical power more effectively than Standard Academic English alternatives. When they describe their emotional response to a text before analyzing its rhetorical strategies, they're not being unprofessional—they're integrating affective intelligence with critical analysis in ways that often produce insights unavailable through purely rational approaches. And further to the point, I am not of a mind to believe that pure rationality exists, at least not as a product of minds in bodies that carry pasts, biases, and beliefs.

Students already understand that different contexts require different communicative strategies. They know how to shift their voice when moving from texting friends to emailing professors, how to adapt their content when addressing different audiences, how to navigate the complex negotiations required for effective communication across communities.

This represents exactly the kind of rhetorical sophistication that academic work demands. Instead of teaching students to think rhetorically—they already do that with remarkable skill—we could help them develop conscious awareness of their existing capabilities and learn to deploy them strategically across academic contexts.

## Assessment and Negotiation

Perhaps most radically, recognizing student sophistication transforms how we evaluate academic work. Instead of measuring student writing against predetermined standards that privilege certain cultural backgrounds, we could develop assessment practices that recognize diverse forms of analytical intelligence.

Students could become partners in creating evaluation criteria rather than passive recipients of external judgment. They could document their intellectual journeys through portfolios that capture thinking processes rather than just final products. They could demonstrate growth through reflection that analyzes their strategic choices rather than apologizing for imagined deficiencies.

When students participate in assessing their own work, they claim intellectual authority rather than waiting for external validation. They develop sustainable relationships with academic discourse by understanding it as one rhetorical option among many rather than the ultimate evolutionary stage of communication development.

This shift from correction to recognition transforms the entire dynamic of education. Students stop performing intellectual helplessness and start demonstrating the analytical capabilities they've always possessed. Faculty stop policing surface-level compliance and start engaging with student thinking. Learning becomes collaborative inquiry rather than hierarchical transmission.

## Bloodless Revolution

When academic institutions begin recognizing student intelligence rather than focusing on deficiencies, everything changes. Students who seemed "unprepared" reveal sophisticated thinking that wasn't being acknowledged. Faculty who felt frustrated by student "resistance" discover that students were responding reasonably to pedagogical approaches that ignored their capabilities.

The need for remediation dramatically decreases when we build on student strengths rather than trying to replace them with academic alternatives. Students can engage in intellectually demanding work immediately rather than spending months or years in preparatory courses that teach them to distrust their own analytical instincts.

Most importantly, education becomes genuinely inclusive when it honors diverse forms of intelligence rather than demanding conformity to narrow academic conventions. Students from communities whose knowledge traditions don't align with dominant academic expectations can contribute their insights rather than learning to suppress them.

This doesn't mean abandoning academic standards. The institutional centripetal forces on writing instruction from all across campus means that we must teach fluency in EAP. What I propose instead is recognizing that rigorous intellectual work can take many forms. Students can engage with complex ideas while simultaneously developing familiarity with academic conventions. They don't need to master traditional forms before they can think critically.

## The Stakes (Pt 2)

**Politics is pedagogy is pedagogy is politics**, and anyone who tries to extricate the two doesn't fully understand either. Current educational systems serve sorting functions that maintain social hierarchies by convincing some students they don't possess the intelligence needed for academic success.

When we recognize that students arrive as sophisticated analysts who need support rather than remediation, we reveal that educational failure often reflects institutional inadequacy rather than student limitation. The problem isn't that students can't think—it's that academic institutions can't recognize their thinking when it doesn't match narrow expectations.

Students who experience recognition rather than correction develop sustainable relationships with learning that serve them throughout their lives. They approach new challenges from positions of intellectual confidence rather than anticipated inadequacy. They understand education as collaborative inquiry rather than individual competition for scarce approval.

Faculty who learn to recognize student capabilities find their teaching becomes more efficient and more satisfying. Instead of spending endless hours correcting surface-level problems, they can engage with student thinking. Instead of managing resistance to arbitrary requirements, they can channel student energy toward meaningful intellectual work.

## Birth of the Author/Death of the Imposter

The transformation begins with a simple but radical premise: students are already sophisticated analysts who deserve educational approaches that honor their intelligence. This doesn't require special programs or expensive interventions—it requires shifting our assumptions about what students bring to learning and what our role is in supporting their intellectual development.

In order to enact this kind of pedagogy though, we must first look inside ourselves, and try to kill the monstrous ego that higher ed produces as a feature, not a bug. But to kill that ego might also produce a pleasant side effect. If we are able to humble ourselves and meet students where they are, which includes being able to learn from them things we don't yet know, we might also find that the eponymous star in the crushing Imposter Complex so endemic in academia, might die as well. If we can accept ourselves as lifelong students (which we should) we might not always feel the pressure of continuously proving our authority.

When we start from recognition rather than deficit, we discover that students possess remarkable capabilities that traditional assessment practices render invisible. Their emotional responses contain analytical insights that purely rational approaches might miss. Their cultural knowledge provides theoretical frameworks that academic training doesn't always supply. Their survival intelligence enables critical analysis of power dynamics that formal education rarely develops.

The question isn't whether students can think—they demonstrate sophisticated thinking daily. The question is whether educational institutions can learn to recognize and build on the intelligence students already possess.

Young's code-meshing CFP pointed toward this possibility: academic discourse that honors rather than erases diverse ways of knowing, institutional spaces that welcome rather than police student voices, educational approaches that recognize sophistication wherever it appears.

**The revolution isn't coming—it's already here**, in every student who refuses to accept that their intelligence doesn't count, in every teacher who chooses recognition over correction, in every moment when authentic learning becomes possible because someone decided to see capability rather than deficit.
