# Exploded Grammars: From Five-Paragraph Prison to Five-Paragraph Prism

A colleague invited me to speak to her graduate seminar about queer theory. I opened by saying that I think lots of theory is useless unless it has some grounding in the real world, using Judith Butler as an example. She spent the next hour chastising me in front of her students—a public intellectual flogging designed to remind everyone of their proper place in the academic hierarchy.

When she finally finished, I said, "Well, I sure hope you yelled loud enough for the plebs on the ground to hear you."

That moment crystallizes everything wrong with how we approach teaching and learning. My colleague wasn't defending Butler or protecting the integrity of queer theory— she wasn't even engaged with queer theory outside of a superfical "Yassss Kween" and the (unspoken but entirely predictable) belief that gays (usually white men) need to be able to legally be fabulous. Instead she was performing her position in the academic food chain by demonstrating proper reverence for canon. Meanwhile, I was trying to have a conversation about how theory might actually connect to lived experience, which was apparently heretical.

But here's what struck me later: in that seminar room, I did exactly what I want my students to feel authorized to do. I refused to hedge ("Well, maybe I'm wrong about theory needing real-world grounding..."). I didn't ventriloquize proper academic deference. I called out the power performance for what it was.

I didn't realize until much later what I meant in my off-the-cuff comment. I meant it to be funny, to cut the tension, but I also, I later realized, meant it to do exactly what it did. It called out classism, the way academics often worship at the most vacuous of altars. They are so in love with their rarified air that they don't realize that it is more like a carbon monoxide leak.

Students already possess this kind of rhetorical sophistication. They wield it every day.

## Turning a Blind Eye

Walk through any college campus and you'll witness rhetorical mastery in action. Students navigate TikTok's compression of meaning into fifteen-second narratives. Often TikTok posts are as vacuous as the aforementioned academic altar, but they aren't always, Sometimes those fifteen second narratives are more packed with meaning than any Butlerian, overwrought, over-constructed chapters. While many traditional academics might decry the short window that TikTok affords their audience, adaptive pedagogues might recognize it as an opportunity to bring to the surface the ways in which TikTok, or X, with all of their length restrictions, actually allow new ways to develop and express ideas in powerful ways.

Students already switch subject positions seamlessly between contexts—formal with professors, intimate with friends, strategic with employers. They craft memes that pack complex social critique into visual punchlines. They orchestrate podcast-style conversations that build intimacy through vulnerability and timing.

Yet when these same students sit down to write academic papers, we pretend they're beginners. We hand them the five-paragraph essay template and act surprised when their writing feels wooden, apologetic, lifeless. We've trained them to write sentences like "It seems like maybe Shakespeare might be trying to suggest..." when they're perfectly capable of saying "Shakespeare argues that..."

The problem isn't their ability. It's that we've taught them their thinking doesn't matter.

## Hedging as Symptom of Much Deeper Issues

Most "bad" student writing stems from hedging, not incompetence. Students have internalized the message that their ideas are inherently suspect, that they need to apologize for taking up intellectual space. They've been taught to ventriloquize academic authority rather than engage authentically with ideas.

But watch what happens when students understand they're already sophisticated meaning-makers. Once they recognize their own rhetorical intelligence—their facility with visual storytelling, their mastery of audience awareness, their intuitive grasp of how different emotional states require different communicative registers—they stop apologizing and start thinking.

This shift happens quickly, almost miraculously. Students who've been producing tentative, generic prose suddenly write with authority and precision. They don't need to "learn to write"—they need permission to think. While we are constantly flooded with ads for technological interventions that will "revolutionize" all aspects of our lives, the real act of innovation often lies in laying bare the processes we take for granted. In this case it is a matter of making students aware of their rhetorical and grammatical sophistication, their fluency in genres and appropriate contexts, and the power inherent in their ability to not just adapt to the genres and rhetorical propriety, but also as what Young and Martinez masterfully call "code-meshing".

Consider how Cardi B's famous coronavirus rant went viral precisely because she meshed vernacular expression with sharp political analysis. She didn't switch into 'proper' broadcast English - she created something new by fusing her Bronx Dominican heritage with urgent public health messaging. 'Coronavirus! Shit is real! Shit is getting real!' carried more immediate truth than any CDC press release. The meshing of codes - not the abandonment of her authentic voice - made her message both accessible and authoritative to audiences traditional public health messaging couldn't reach.

## From Prison to Prism

I call this approach "exploded grammars"—a pedagogical framework that recognizes all the ways students already make meaning. Traditional grammar and rhetoric count for sure, but so do visual storytelling, sonic communication strategies, digital literacies, the sophisticated code-switching they perform across platforms and contexts.

Consider how students understand that different spaces require different voices. They know Instagram demands different energy than LinkedIn, that a text to their grandmother uses different grammar than a DM to their crush. They intuitively grasp what composition theorists call "rhetorical situation"—they just haven't been taught to recognize this knowledge as intellectual sophistication. In fact, they are often chastised for not meeting the prescriptions of the composition classroom, while the instructors might not ever think to ask instead how students might be enriching the academic experience in the writing classroom.

What I want to consider is deeper than the superficial deployment of grammars and rhetorics across artificially disparate contexts. Young and Martinez's concept of "code meshing" instead allows us to conceptualize a dynamic, creative blending of different linguistic systems that generates new possibilities for meaning-making. They're not just switching between separate codes like changing clothes; they're creating hybrid forms of expression that draw on multiple cultural and linguistic resources simultaneously.

When we build bridges between their existing competencies and academic contexts, everything changes. Instead of asking students to abandon their rhetorical intelligence, or worse, punishing them for it, we help them understand how to mesh it productively with academic discourse—creating new forms of expression that honor both their cultural knowledge and institutional requirements. These bridges will not only help students build the necessary metacognitive processes, but also help them understand the way power structures that have been constructed to privilege certain voices, certain skin tones, certain sexual and gender identities.

## How Trauma Connects

This approach becomes even more crucial when we consider how traditional academic discourse can function as a form of linguistic colonialism. Students from marginalized communities often resist "proper" academic voice not because they can't master it, but because it can't hold their experience.

I think of Diamanda Galás's Plague Mass, her AIDS-era performances that used sounds conventional audiences found "uncomfortable." For communities experiencing collective trauma, those supposedly harsh vocal registers were actually comforting—they matched the emotional reality in ways that polite discourse never could.

Students who've been told their home languages, their cultural references, their ways of making meaning are "wrong" learn to hedge as a survival strategy. Not only does this undermine their senses of themselves as adept and competent communicators, it plays into the ways that marginalized communities learn to internalize themselves as inept, unworthy, not white, or straight, or male enough, to deserve a place at the table. But resistance to academic discourse might actually be a form of rhetorical intelligence—an intuitive understanding that some experiences require different forms of expression.

The solution isn't to abandon academic discourse but to teach students how to mesh it productively with their existing linguistic resources—creating hybrid forms of expression that can navigate institutional power structures while honoring their full range of meaning-making capabilities.

## Rhizomatic Innovative Pedagogy

Genuine pedagogical innovation isn't about iPads or AI or whatever buzzword administrators are currently monetizing. It's about recognizing the intellectual work students are already doing and helping them see connections between their existing sophistication and new contexts.

In practice, this means:

- Using first drafts to get performative expectations out of students' systems, then teaching revision as "exploded diagram"—helping students see where additional information serves their actual arguments
- Showing students where their authentic voice breaks through formal constraints and building from there
- Teaching code meshing as a creative, generative practice rather than pretending academic voice is universally superior
- Validating forms of expression that have been pathologized while providing tools for institutional navigation
- Helping students recognize that their real thinking is more interesting than generic academic performance
- Pushing back constantly on the concept that soulless corporate jargon, including the visual and sonic rhetorical moves deployed in advertisement, is actually persuasive

Like rhizomes that spread horizontally rather than hierarchically, the important work is to resist centering ourselves as arbiters of right and wrong, and instead recognize student work as a richly imbricated field of ongoing action—multiple entry points, no fixed beginning or end, always already in motion. Since students cannot possibly make visible all the hidden rhetorical processes they navigate while composing, we must invite them to engage in metacognition as they draft and to become equal partners in their own assessment.

## Liberatory Pedagogy v2

When students understand they're already rhetorically sophisticated, they stop apologizing for taking up space. The focus shifts from "learning to write" to making strategic communication choices. Students move from hedging and ventriloquizing to authentic intellectual engagement. The most beneficial side effect though, is that they gain a sense of self, of worth, and a confidence in their own integrity. They will be more savvy consumers, better citizens, more productive in ways for which capitalism refuses a metric.

This is fundamentally about intellectual liberation—helping students recognize and trust their own rhetorical intelligence while providing tools to navigate institutional power structures. It's about authorizing students to think rather than merely perform thinking. To adapt an age-old cliche, this is about teaching them how, not what, to think.

The same forces that trained those graduate students to sit silently while their professor performed proper academic hierarchy also train undergraduates to write "It seems like maybe..." The hedging goes all the way up the food chain.

But students already know how to cut through bullshit—they do it in their actual conversations, in their cultural production, in their navigation of complex social media ecosystems. What if instead of training them out of that rhetorical intelligence, we helped them recognize it as critical thinking? And what if, even further, we authorized them, literally gave them the authority, to push back at ideas that we teach them, to challenge us, but most importantly to think critically about what merits pushback, what rhetorical moves would be persuasive, and how to ground their pushback as immediate and necessary.

The writing classroom, properly conceived, becomes a space where students learn to trust their own voices while gaining fluency in the codes they need for institutional success. Not because those codes are inherently superior, but because they're tools for accessing and potentially transforming systems of power. Rather than English For Academic Purposes, the lingua franca of academia, being superior, we can teach them that it is another tool in their rhetorical toolkit, and further, we can destabilize it, show how its history as shibboleth, as racist, misogynistic, homo- and transphobic, can be decentered. We can teach it as a framework for collective meaning-making, but we can mesh our own codes, those that affirm our own personal values, as valid.

When we stop treating students as empty vessels waiting to be filled with proper discourse and start recognizing them as sophisticated rhetoricians who've been systematically dis-authorized from their own intelligence, everything becomes possible. The five-paragraph prison dissolves. The hedging stops. Students remember they have something to say, and the right to say it.

And sometimes, just sometimes, they find the perfect words to call out the emperor's new clothes: "Well, I sure hope you yelled loud enough for the plebs on the ground to hear you."

That's the voice we want to cultivate—not because it's rebellious, but because it's clear. Because it's honest and respectful of students' heritage and their own cultural integrity. Because it refuses to apologize for thinking. Because it recognizes that authentic intellectual engagement requires the courage to speak from where you actually stand rather than where you think you're supposed to.

Students already have this courage. We just need to stop training them out of it.
