# The Mutual Liberation of Learning: How Academic Hierarchies Impoverish Everyone

Academic institutions have perfected a particularly exhausting form of self-delusion: the performance of professorial omniscience. Faculty members spend their careers maintaining the fiction that they understand all forms of meaning-making, that their disciplinary training provides complete frameworks for analyzing contemporary complexity, that they must know everything before they can teach anything. Students, meanwhile, are matriculated with an inherent sense intellectual helplessness or incompetence, waiting for external validation rather than trusting their own analytical capabilities.

This system creates what I call "intellectual poverty" that diminishes everyone involved. When academic spaces systematically exclude diverse forms of intelligence, they produce knowledge that reflects the limited perspectives of those with institutional access rather than the full range of human insight needed to understand complex problems.

But what if we recognized that liberation from these hierarchies benefits faculty as much as students? What if the same pedagogical approaches that honor student intelligence could free professors from the impossible burden of academic omniscience?

## When Your House Is Made of Straw

The colleague who commandeered my master's thesis seminar perfectly exemplified how academic violence destroys learning for everyone involved. She transformed what should have been a space for emerging scholarly voices into a site of rigid prescription—lecturing students about proper theoretical frameworks instead of supporting their intellectual discovery, demanding conformity to predetermined methods rather than honoring their emergent ideas.

The seminar failed because we cannot prescribe original thinking into existence. We cannot schedule intellectual discovery or rage-lecture students into finding their own voices, no matter how hard we try. Her furious certainty that students needed correction rather than recognition created exactly the kind of authoritarian dynamic that kills genuine learning. This systemic exclusion might produce well-disicplined members of the classroom, but it doesn't produce students in any real definition of the term. We ask students to think; we ask robots to obey.

But her pedagogy also trapped her in an exhausting performance. She had to maintain the fiction of knowing the single correct way to engage with theory, the right method for developing scholarship, the proper relationship between students and knowledge. Instead of exploring ideas collaboratively, she spent her energy policing boundaries and defending territory. In this view, the relationship between students and knowledge will always be defined my its load-bearing wall.

This is the hidden cost of traditional academic hierarchies: they require faculty to perform expertise they don't fully possess while preventing them from acknowledging the limitations that make learning possible. When professors must pretend to understand all forms of meaning-making, they can't engage authentically with student insights that exceed their training. When they must maintain authority over predetermined knowledge, they can't participate in the kind of collaborative inquiry that generates new understanding.

## Stagnation And Rot

The deepest irony is that pursuing a PhD requires dedicating ourselves to lifelong scholarship—which is to say, lifelong learning. We may become teachers, but the crux of our professional existence is maintaining curiosity, intellectual growth, and openness to new understanding. Yet the moment we enter the classroom, academic culture demands we perform as if that learning process has ended, as if our degrees granted us omniscience rather than permission to keep investigating. The centripetal forces that operated well before our induction into the academic community hands us the watch of the gates, a certain shibboleth that denies perceived interlopers.

This creates an impossible contradiction. Scholars must pretend they no longer need to learn, researchers can't acknowledge uncertainty, lifelong students must perform as if their education is complete. The very intellectual humility that makes good scholarship possible becomes professionally dangerous in academic hierarchies that mistake authority for expertise and certainty for rigor. It is no surprise that the most aggressive members of the keep are also the members who reap the most benefits, who advance the furthest, propelled straight to the miasma of academic middle administration, or to chair IRB committees, or to destroy graduate programs.

We become trapped in what amounts to professional cognitive dissonance—publicly performing certainty while privately wrestling with the questions that make our research compelling. The curiosity that drives our scholarship gets compartmentalized away from our teaching, as if wondering and knowing were incompatible rather than interdependent.

## Bankrupted Ethics and Intellectual Poverty

Consider what academic institutions lose when they systematically exclude diverse forms of intelligence. Students who could contribute powerful insights to scholarly conversations learn to silence themselves. Communities whose knowledge could enrich academic understanding get positioned as objects of study rather than partners in inquiry. The very people who most need access to critical analysis of power structures get excluded from spaces where that analysis happens.

This creates a vicious cycle of intellectual impoverishment. Academic "excellence" (the hollowest academic buzzword imaginable) becomes increasingly disconnected from the communities universities claim to serve. Knowledge production becomes the privilege of those who can afford years of training in specialized discourse, while the insights of those most affected by social problems get dismissed as unscholarly. The phallogocentric rules, both implicit and implicit, that govern academic discourse and power structures feel comfortable dismissing embodied, affective responses to academic knowledge production, shields those in power, and designs and blazes the paths for those who wish to, and are allowed to, assume power. In other words, those in power are able to retain their power by dismissing as incompetent those who would challenge their power. And I guess that makes sense, because challenging those in power does tend to hurt their feelings.

The result isn't rigor—it's a fucking ethical and intellectual slipknot that just gets tighter the more you pull against it. The harder institutions work to maintain "standards" through exclusion, the more they constrict their own capacity for understanding. When academic spaces exclude the survival intelligence that students develop navigating hostile environments, they lose access to sophisticated pattern recognition that formal training rarely provides. When they dismiss the intersectional analysis that emerges from lived experience, they miss insights about power dynamics that theoretical frameworks might not capture. When they pathologize emotional engagement with ideas, they eliminate the passionate investment that often generates the most innovative thinking.

Students enter our classrooms possessing remarkable analytical sophistication—not despite their emotional responses, cultural knowledge, and embodied ways of knowing, but because of them. They navigate complex social situations with expertise that often exceeds what formal training provides. They demonstrate strategic communication across multiple contexts, sophisticated understanding of power dynamics, and innovative approaches to meaning-making that could enrich rather than threaten academic discourse.

But instead of recognizing this intelligence, academic institutions position students as lacking the capabilities they demonstrably possess. This deprives all members of the academic community of the intellectual partnerships that could transform our own understanding.

## The Rictus Pose of Community Engagement

This intellectual poverty reveals a particularly stark contradiction in how universities position themselves publicly. Academic institutions constantly trumpet their commitment to "community engagement," "public service," and "democratic participation." They market themselves as bridges between scholarly knowledge and community needs, champions of social justice who exist to serve the public good. 

The difference between posture and pose is that posture connotes a dedication to a correct stance, one that ensures integrity and prevents against skeletal or muscular maladaptations. A pose is fleeting, meant only as a rhetorical device to persuade the viewer one way or the other. When universities maintain authentic posture toward community engagement, they're protecting their institutional integrity—maintaining alignment between their stated mission and their actual practices, strengthening the foundational structures that allow them to serve their educational purpose. This kind of genuine commitment requires ongoing attention and adjustment, like maintaining good physical posture, but it prevents the institutional damage that comes from misalignment. Posing, by contrast, creates exactly the kind of structural maladaptations that compromise long-term institutional health. Universities that merely pose for community engagement while maintaining exclusionary practices are like bodies held in artificial positions for photographs—they might look impressive in marketing materials, but the performance creates internal stress, weakens core stability, and ultimately damages their capacity to function as genuine educational institutions. The pose becomes a kind of institutional scoliosis, where the superficial appearance of proper alignment masks a fundamental structural compromise that grows more damaging over time.

Scratch beneath the surface rhetoric and "community engagement" often translates to "business partnership"—a cynical cash grab that extends university access only to those who can pay. The "community" these institutions actually serve consists of corporate sponsors, wealthy donors, and fee-paying professional development clients, not the working-class neighborhoods surrounding campus or the first-generation students struggling with tuition.

When universities establish "community partnerships," they're typically courting organizations with budgets rather than building relationships with grassroots movements. When they celebrate "community engagement," they mean revenue-generating programs that treat local residents as consumers rather than intellectual partners. The communities that actually need educational resources get tokenized through occasional service projects while real institutional power flows toward those with economic leverage.

This exposes something more hollow than a savior complex—it's educational capitalism masquerading as social responsibility. Universities have learned to perform community engagement while maintaining the very market-driven assumptions that exclude genuine community participation. They'll host corporate training seminars while dismissing the survival intelligence of their own students. They'll partner with law firms for continuing education while positioning working-class community knowledge as unscholarly. The public-facing side of community engagement is rarely any thicker than the paint used on storefronts to advertise the schools' mascots, or Greek organizations.

The result is a particularly insidious form of gatekeeping that appears democratic while remaining fundamentally transactional. Universities can point to their revenue streams from "community partnerships" while continuing to operate from the assumption that real education requires payment rather than participation.

## The Power in Being Seen

When we acknowledge that students already possess sophisticated analytical capabilities, something remarkable happens: faculty escape the exhausting performance of omniscience that traditional hierarchies demand. Instead of positioning ourselves as the sole source of analytical intelligence in the classroom, we become facilitators of assemblages that keep reconfiguring as students bring cultural knowledge, affective vocabularies, and survival intelligence that exceed what any individual professor could possess.

This mutual liberation transforms the fundamental dynamics of academic authority. Faculty no longer need to maintain the fiction that they understand all forms of meaning-making. Students' code-meshing strategies can teach us about linguistic innovation. Their multimodal sophistication can reveal analytical possibilities we hadn't considered. Their intersectional intelligence can illuminate patterns of power and resistance that our theoretical frameworks might miss.

The classroom becomes a space where "I don't know, but let's figure it out together" becomes intellectually rigorous rather than professionally dangerous. Faculty maintain responsibility for creating pedagogical conditions that support learning while recognizing that the intelligence emerging through those conditions exceeds what they could generate alone.

This doesn't diminish professorial authority—it transforms it from territorial defense of predetermined knowledge toward intellectual leadership in collective inquiry. In fact, such territorialization doesn't reflect power, but fear. It is what really operating from unexamined feeling looks like. Real power comes from shared purpose, recognition, and community. We become co-learners in assemblages that continue to reconfigure precisely because we're no longer constrained by the fiction that we must know everything before we can teach anything.

## I Believe That Students Are the Future

Current educational systems serve sorting functions that maintain social hierarchies by convincing some students they don't possess the intelligence needed for academic success. But this sorting also traps faculty in performances of expertise that prevent genuine intellectual engagement.

When we recognize that students arrive as sophisticated analysts who need support rather than remediation, we reveal that educational failure often reflects institutional inadequacy rather than student limitation. The problem isn't that students can't think—it's that academic institutions can't recognize their thinking when it doesn't match narrow expectations.

Faculty who learn to recognize student capabilities find their teaching becomes more efficient and more satisfying. Instead of spending endless hours correcting surface-level problems, they can engage with student thinking. Instead of managing resistance to arbitrary requirements, they can channel student energy toward meaningful intellectual work. There can be no doubt that in writing classrooms there are extrinsic forces on us to teach EAP, but by making current-tradtional pedagogy the focus of our instruction, we ourselves become surface-level instructors. EAP is a privileged dialect, but only in its own sphere of influence. If we can show students that they are already fluent in myriad dialects, and this is one more they can adapt to achieve entry to that particular sphere of influence, we are no longer correcting them; we are recognizing them as savvy and fluent communicators.

Students who experience recognition rather than correction develop sustainable relationships with learning that serve them throughout their lives. They approach new challenges from positions of intellectual confidence rather than anticipated inadequacy. They understand education as collaborative inquiry rather than individual competition for scarce approval.

## Toto Pulls Back the Curtain

The transformation begins with a simple but radical premise: everyone involved in education possesses forms of intelligence that could contribute to collective understanding. Students arrive with analytical sophistication that formal training didn't provide. Faculty bring disciplinary knowledge that could be enriched rather than threatened by diverse perspectives. Learning becomes possible when these capabilities combine rather than compete.

This recognition creates conditions where scholarship can emerge from the full range of human knowing rather than the artificially constrained fiction of disembodied analysis. Academic discourse can honor diverse ways of meaning-making rather than demanding conformity to exclusionary conventions. Assessment practices can recognize analytical capabilities rather than policing surface-level compliance.

The mutual liberation of learning requires abandoning the fiction that education involves transmitting predetermined knowledge from expert faculty to deficient students. Instead, it becomes collaborative research where everyone involved investigates meaning-making together, where authority emerges through intellectual leadership rather than territorial control, where the goal becomes supporting the sophisticated thinking that's already happening rather than replacing it with academic alternatives.

When academic institutions stop impoverishing themselves through systematic exclusion, they discover that students and faculty together possess the intellectual resources needed for genuine inquiry. The revolution isn't coming—it's already here, waiting for us to recognize the intelligence that's been present all along.
