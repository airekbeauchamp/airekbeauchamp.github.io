# Compound Exclusion: Or How to Oppress Inside the Lines

*Note: This piece revisits and expands on examples I've shared previously, diving deeper into how these incidents reveal patterns of systemic exclusion in academic spaces.*

I'm sitting in a cluttered office during my graduate school years, surrounded by comic books, action figures, and Funko Pop collectibles that line every available shelf and surface. The faculty member across from me gestures toward his collection with obvious pride, explaining how these objects represent serious academic investigation. When the conversation shifts to a colleague—a tenure-track sound studies scholar—his tone changes entirely. He dismisses her scholarship as "fangirling," suggesting her passion reveals emotional investment that undermines serious academic work.

This moment crystallized something I'd been struggling to articulate about how exclusion operates in academic spaces. It wasn't simple sexism or straightforward bias. It was what I've come to call **"compound exclusion"**—the simultaneous deployment of multiple overlapping systems that deploy aggressive erasure to forms of knowledge the academy pays lip service to, yet refuses to fully sanction. Instead of understanding the deeply imbricated forms of identity and identity politic, instead of respecting the potentiality in this rhizomatic approach to knowledge- and meaning-making, the unwritten but deeply inscribed rules still use what I call a **deficit-added approach to education**. In this approach, each individual marker, non-white, non-straight, non-male, non-affluent, differently-abled, speaks to a deficiency in the student to be remediated, if not ignored.

## Moving Beyond a Deficit-Added Approach

Traditional academic approaches to social justice typically operate through additive logic: composition studies plus some attention to race, plus some acknowledgment of disability, plus some recognition of linguistic diversity. But this approach fundamentally misunderstands how exclusion actually functions. It treats intersectional identities as separate, stackable categories rather than recognizing how multiple systems of oppression operate simultaneously to create novel forms of marginalization.

Compound exclusion reveals why these additive approaches consistently fail. When my colleague dismissed the sound studies scholar as "fangirling," he deployed gendered assumptions about embodied knowledge, affect-phobic dismissal of passionate engagement, and linguistic violence that codes feminine enthusiasm as analytical incompetence—all simultaneously. No single anti-bias intervention could address how these systems worked together to naturalize her exclusion while legitimizing his own embodied engagement with pop culture artifacts.

Understanding compound exclusion becomes particularly urgent as educational institutions integrate AI and other emerging technologies. These tools risk amplifying existing patterns of exclusion precisely because they're often designed through the same additive logic that fails to recognize how marginalization actually operates. When we build "inclusive" AI without understanding compound exclusion, we create systems that appear neutral while systematically disadvantaging students whose intelligence doesn't conform to narrow algorithmic definitions of legitimate analysis. And this model seems to be optimized for the unexamined deployment of any tech. The engineers, like many of us, are unable to see their own blindspots. This is compounded, in educational technology, by the fact that administrators are usually invested only in the lowest common denominator, or steamrolling the student experience until it is flattened to the point of pure transparency, with all the richness and texture of lived reality overridden.

## Case Study 1: Girl as a Weapon

The Funko Pop office encounter reveals how compound exclusion operates through seemingly contradictory standards that actually work together to maintain hierarchies. His embodied engagement with popular culture objects gets coded as legitimate scholarly investigation—evidence of analytical sophistication and theoretical rigor. Her embodied engagement with sound gets dismissed as feminine emotion that disqualifies her from "real" academic work. The same passionate intellectual investment that validates his expertise becomes evidence of her analytical incompetence.

This example is easy to dismiss as simple gender bias, but in reality is much more complex, with roots that snake through history and culture and myriad other stratifications. The compound operation of multiple systems: gendered assumptions about whose bodies can legitimately engage with intellectual objects, affect-phobic academic cultures that pathologize emotional investment, disciplinary hierarchies that position certain research areas as more rigorous than others, and linguistic violence that reduces complex scholarly engagement to dismissive shorthand like "fangirling." Somehow, in this situation, I was to ignore, if not actually be blind to, the fact that his office itself was a monument to fanboying, or I guess what we might just, if we are playing by the rules at hand, fandom.

Each system amplifies the others. The gendered dismissal gains legitimacy through appeals to academic objectivity, which as a concept is as outdated and distasteful as smoking in restaurants. The affect-phobia gets naturalized through disciplinary hierarchies that purport to be inclusive, while bootlickers on the ground happily police the gates. The linguistic violence appears justified through institutional standards about appropriate scholarly discourse. Together, they create a form of exclusion that exceeds what any single system could accomplish while making that exclusion appear natural, inevitable, and professionally justified. The simple morphology, the suffix "girling" is suddenly an explosion of implicit denials, dismissals, and deficit-attribution.

This compound operation explains why traditional diversity initiatives often fail to address academic exclusion. Training focused solely on gender bias wouldn't address the affect-phobia. Workshops on inclusive language wouldn't challenge the disciplinary hierarchies. Policies about respectful workplace communication wouldn't touch the deeper systems that make her passionate expertise threatening to institutional authority.

These compound exclusions operate through what we might recognize as the persistent ghost of Cartesian dualism - the mind/body split that positions "real" intelligence as disembodied, rational, and objective. This foundational binary creates all the other hierarchies: standard vs. non-standard English, objective vs. emotional analysis, academic vs. experiential knowledge. Actually inclusive education requires dismantling these power differentials entirely, recognizing that non-traditional students with their complex lives and non-standard Englishes aren't deficient subjects needing remediation - they're rich repositories of analytical sophistication that could transform what counts as legitimate knowledge.

My concern here isn't about redistributed power. Instead, I find it worth remembering that hierarchical systems themselves tend to corrupt - that gaining access to institutional authority often reproduces the same exclusions we once faced. Jenny Holzer's observation that 'change is valuable when the oppressed become tyrants' isn't a warning against justice, but a reminder that sustainable transformation requires changing the structures, not just who gets to wield them. We see this dynamic clearly in recent 'girl boss' culture - women gaining access to corporate power while keeping exploitative structures completely intact. Having female CEOs doesn't challenge capitalism; it just diversifies who gets to profit from it.

## Case Study 2: Respectability With a Sneer

The "queer" archive panel at the Conference on College Composition and Communication demonstrated how compound exclusion operates through simultaneously deployed systems of racial, class, and respectability politics. Three cisgender white gay male scholars spent forty-five minutes cataloguing artifacts from local Pride celebrations: photographs of parade floats sponsored by corporate law firms, newsletters from well-funded community organizations, memorabilia from galas held at country clubs.

When I asked about the absence of lesbian histories, people of color, or poor community members, their response revealed the compound nature of the exclusion. This was, they explained, a personal archive reflecting the "geographically specific" nature of their local community. The historical record simply reflected who had been there.

But this naturalization of absence operated through multiple overlapping systems. Colonial knowledge structures defined "proper" archival subjects as those whose lives could be documented through formal institutions and financial records. Racialized class assumptions privileged middle-class white gay male experiences as representative of "queer" history. Respectability politics positioned assimilation narratives as evidence of community progress rather than exclusion. Academic discourse provided theoretical frameworks that legitimized these choices as scholarly rather than political. One of the most basic truths, though, about queer politics, is that no matter how many smug, cis-white academics are comfortable colonizing the framework, there is no point at which it abuts respectability politics.

Each system just reinforced the others. The colonial knowledge structures gained legitimacy through academic respectability. The class bias got naturalized through geographical specificity claims. The respectability politics appeared justified through theoretical sophistication. Together, they formed an insurmountable wave of white noise designed to not just colonize, but deflect from the actual audience that the term "queer" represents. This form of assimilation too was a genteel and constantly gentrifying form of violence of the most insidious variety. My colleague's observation—"They're using our language to erase us"—captured the particular violence of this compound exclusion. The scholars had learned to speak fluently in the vocabulary of inclusion while using that very vocabulary to exclude anyone whose existence might complicate their narrative of progress through assimilation. It had all the hallmarks of a Southern sheriff nodding politely in the afternoon at someone that, later that night, was scheduled to be lynched.

## Case Study 3: When the Petit-Bourgeoisie Have the Keys to the Tower

The third encounter revealed how compound exclusion operates through simultaneous deployment of accessibility barriers and intellectual gatekeeping. When I suggested that Judith Butler's theoretical complexity often serves exclusionary rather than analytical purposes, my colleague's hour-long public chastisement revealed what was really at stake.

Consider Butler's prize-winning sentence: "The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power."

Ninety-four words. One sentence. Zero accessibility to anyone outside the theoretical priesthood.

This exclusion operates through compound systems: linguistic barriers that require years of specialized training to decode, institutional hierarchies that position theoretical complexity as inherently superior to accessible thought, class-based assumptions about who deserves access to critical insights about power, and academic cultures that treat questioning accessibility as evidence of intellectual inadequacy.

The tragedy is that Butler writes about how power operates—exactly the knowledge that marginalized students need to understand their own experiences. But those students are systematically excluded from these insights through deliberately impenetrable prose that serves gatekeeping rather than educational purposes.

## Machines of Loving Grace

While there are undoubtedly some techbros whose aspirations are firmly in the evil genius range (and few hit either marker, unless we are counting the banal kinds of evil, which I don't find to be remotely aspirational), most are just like the rest of us: victims of their own particularly human set of blind spots. This does not exonerate them (or any of the rest of us) but it does hopefully allow us a more compassionate reading of the situation, and a more robust set of lenses for how to work within tech frameworks to undo these blindspots.

Understanding compound exclusion becomes crucial as educational institutions integrate AI and other emerging technologies. Current approaches to "inclusive" AI often reproduce the same additive logic that fails to address how exclusion actually operates. We build bias detection systems focused on single categories—race or gender or disability—without recognizing how these systems interact to create novel forms of marginalization.

Consider how AI writing assessment tools might evaluate student work. A system trained on "standard" academic discourse might flag code-meshing as error, emotional engagement as unprofessional, and cultural knowledge as irrelevant tangent—simultaneously deploying linguistic, affect-phobic, and epistemic exclusions that compound to render sophisticated student analysis invisible to algorithmic assessment.

Similarly, "personalized learning" platforms often personalize delivery methods while maintaining narrow definitions of legitimate knowledge. They might adapt to different learning styles while continuing to privilege certain forms of cultural knowledge, certain ways of demonstrating understanding, certain relationships between emotion and analysis. The personalization masks the compound exclusions operating through curricular choices, assessment criteria, and pedagogical assumptions.

Virtual and augmented reality tools present particular risks for compound exclusion. These technologies could create immersive learning experiences that honor diverse ways of knowing—or they could amplify existing exclusions by embedding them in seemingly neutral technological interfaces. VR experiences designed around dominant cultural assumptions, AR tools that require specific forms of embodied interaction, AI tutors that respond only to particular communication styles—all risk creating compound exclusions that appear as technological rather than social limitations.

## Namaste, But Make It Pedagogy

Addressing compound exclusion requires moving beyond additive diversity approaches toward what I call "recognition-based solutions"—pedagogical and technological approaches that honor the complex assemblages through which students already make meaning.

Instead of trying to correct student "deficiencies," recognition-based approaches build on the sophisticated analytical capabilities students already possess. Instead of fragmenting intersectional experiences into separate diversity categories, they honor the complex ways students navigate multiple systems simultaneously. Instead of requiring students to translate their insights into narrow academic conventions, they create spaces where diverse forms of intelligence can contribute to collective knowledge production.

The promise and potentiality in emerging technologies can revolutionize pedagogy, but not in the ways that AI panic might lead us to believe. Rather than replacing human intelligence, these technologies can make it visible in new ways.

### VR as Reality Construction Lab

Virtual reality offers something unprecedented: the ability to see how entire worlds get built, choice by choice. When students analyze VR environments, they're not just playing with cool technology—they're developing sophisticated frameworks for understanding how any constructed space shapes meaning and experience. VR is, if nothing else, actually epistemic in nature.

In VR, every environmental choice becomes visible and questionable. Why is the virtual classroom arranged this way? What does the lighting communicate about authority? How does the scale of objects affect the user's sense of agency? Students critiquing these design decisions are doing exactly the kind of critical analysis that traditional education claims to develop, but rarely makes concrete.

More importantly, students who understand VR world-building start recognizing how physical classrooms are also constructed spaces that privilege certain ways of knowing. The student who notices that a VR library positions books as decoration rather than tools for interaction might also notice how traditional academic spaces make certain bodies feel unwelcome. VR analysis becomes training for recognizing the hidden curriculum embedded in any learning environment. We might think of this in traditional rhet/comp language and categorize it as transfer but I think there is something much more Spinozan happening here: what VR can create is an ongoing affective field in which the virtual teaches us about the concrete world, and vice-versa, in an ongoing play of intensities.

### AI as Thinking Made Visible

Meanwhile, AI tools that can articulate their reasoning processes offer something equally revolutionary: the chance to watch thinking happen in real time. When students dialogue with AI about analytical choices, they're not just getting writing help—they're developing awareness of their own cognitive strategies.

This matters because academic institutions consistently fail to teach metacognitive processes. We tell students to "analyze" or "think critically" without ever showing them what analytical thinking actually looks like as it unfolds. We give them a semester of limited research training and expect them to write the Moby Dick of term papers without considering that we ourselves can take years to write a 20-page journal article. And what happens in those years is not as much actual, manual writing, but wrestling with the ideas and how to best breathe life into them. AI that can narrate its decision-making process gives students access to this usually invisible intellectual work.

The pedagogical potential in AI comes from the actual interaction. When students negotiate meaning with AI, they often have to articulate their own analytical approaches in ways traditional assignments never require. A student explaining to AI why their grandmother's migration story contains sophisticated theoretical insights isn't just defending their work—they're developing conscious awareness of analytical capabilities they may never have recognized they possessed. Articulating their ideas with AI can help a first-year writer, when tasked with the pervasive "that time I learned a lesson" assignment, can move beyond what I call the bumper sticker lessons: never taking anything for granted (which is categorically untrue, as well as reductive), or how important family is (not when you have one like mine), and into what they mean. Learning a new appreciation for the fleeting things in life is different that hollow rhetoric, and the importance of family, and the historical and cultural facets of familial bonds deserves more that "nothing is more important than family". I am tempted to make a joke about being able to eat your family here, but the Donner Party feels like just yesterday, so it's probably too soon.

### Recognition Training for Everyone

Working with these technologies could transform how faculty learn to recognize sophisticated analysis that doesn't look traditionally academic. When students critique VR design choices or negotiate complex ideas with AI, they demonstrate exactly the kind of multifaceted thinking that traditional assessment often renders invisible. And, let's face it, with growing class sizes, the mountain of grading, and the improbable emphasis on producing publications as research budgets are pruned down to bare stem, asking students to engage in this without some kind of third-party interaction is unreasonable in terms of our time and theirs. But if we can show them how to ethically engage with emergent technologies in ways that are critical, and that help them find their bearings as thinkers navigating the academic environment in a way that allows us to oversee without policing, we are looking at an potential seismic shift in how students learn to engage with the world around them, responsible and critically.

A student who can identify how VR environmental choices reproduce colonial power structures while simultaneously designing alternative experiences shows sophisticated understanding of how technology embeds ideology. A student who can teach AI to recognize cultural code-switching as analytical strategy rather than error demonstrates theoretical sophistication that exceeds many graduate-level discussions of linguistic diversity. Beyond the base-level benefits, though, students can feel a sense of their own agency in their education, which is the ultimate force-multiplier.

These interactions give faculty concrete examples of student intelligence in action. Instead of looking for predetermined markers of academic success, faculty can observe students actively using their cultural knowledge, emotional intelligence, and critical awareness to solve complex problems and negotiate meaning across different systems.

## Beyond Individual Learning

The meta benefits extend beyond individual skill development. When classrooms become spaces where VR world-building and AI dialogue happen regularly, they model the kind of collaborative knowledge production that recognition-based pedagogy advocates. Students aren't just consuming information or demonstrating predetermined competencies—they're actively creating understanding through technological partnerships that honor their existing sophistication. This approach actually allows us the possibility to dispose of the banking model of education completely, and tbh good riddance.

This transforms the fundamental dynamic of education. Faculty stop being the sole sources of analytical intelligence and become facilitators of assemblages that keep reconfiguring as students, AI, and immersive environments interact. The classroom becomes a research lab where human and artificial intelligence combine to investigate questions that exceed what any individual mind could explore alone. This approach actually allows us to renegotiate the classroom as a place of collective meaning making, and to dispel ourselves of the lone genius archetype, the scholar working by himself (emphasis on "him" mine) and tbh good riddance.

For AI and educational technology, this means developing tools that can recognize sophistication wherever it appears rather than measuring student work against predetermined templates of legitimate analysis. It means creating assessment systems that honor code-meshing as linguistic innovation, emotional engagement as analytical insight, and cultural knowledge as theoretical sophistication. This approach actually allows us to decenter Descartes and all the power differentials his dualisms brought to our culture, and tbh good riddance.

Most importantly, it requires understanding that students' resistance to academic conventions often represents exactly the kind of intersectional analysis that recognizes how seemingly neutral educational practices reproduce multiple systems of oppression simultaneously. Their resistance exceeds what any single theoretical framework can recognize or support, requiring the kind of recognition-based pedagogy that honors rather than fragments their analytical sophistication.

The question isn't whether students can think—they demonstrate sophisticated thinking daily. The question is whether educational institutions can learn to recognize and build on the intelligence students already possess, creating learning environments that honor rather than harm the complex assemblages through which they make meaning.

When we understand how compound exclusion operates, we can begin building educational approaches that recognize sophistication wherever it appears, support diverse ways of knowing, and create genuine rather than performative inclusion. The revolution isn't coming—it's already here, in every student who refuses to accept that their intelligence doesn't count, in every teacher who chooses recognition over correction, in every moment when learning becomes possible because someone decided to see capability rather than deficit.
