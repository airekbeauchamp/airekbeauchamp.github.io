# From The Margins
## A Personal Journey in Transformative Education

### The Awakening

I wasn't supposed to make anything of myself. Growing up dirt poor, I was smart—sometimes a smart ass—but had no idea how to direct that intelligence. The constant message was clear: kids like me didn't have futures that mattered. I turned to substances to numb the frustration of having a mind that worked but no roadmap for where it could take me.

Then I met Dr. Pam Hearn in Composition II. She didn't just teach me to write; she taught me to think. More than that, she saw something in me that I couldn't see in myself. Through her mentorship, I found my way into Women's Studies, where I became the only male to graduate the program with a 4.0. But the real education wasn't in the grades—it was in learning that intellectual growth itself was worthwhile, that the journey of discovery was as valuable as any destination.

Pam and her husband Charles, who taught literature with the kind of deep contextualization that showed me how everything connects to everything else, didn't just educate me—they welcomed me into their family. They showed me what transformative education looks like: it's relational, it's personal, and it changes lives.

### The Realization

That experience became my pedagogical DNA. I learned every day what I learned from Pam: that education is fundamentally about human transformation, not information transfer. When I teach writing, I'm not just teaching the five-paragraph essay—I'm teaching students to see themselves as thinkers capable of original insight, as voices that matter in academic and public discourse.

This understanding deepened through my doctoral work in writing studies at SUNY Binghamton, where I began to see how academic disciplines shape identity and how power structures in education either liberate or constrain student potential. My dissertation on the academic identities of dissertation writers wasn't just academic exercise—it was personal investigation into how we become the scholars we are.

### The Innovation

At Arkansas State University, I had the opportunity to put these insights into practice on a larger scale. As Director of Writing Support Innovations, I built programs that weren't just theoretically sound but practically transformative. Growing our online writing center by 300% in its first year wasn't about chasing metrics—it was about creating accessible pathways for students who, like my younger self, had intelligence but needed guidance on how to use it.

Securing $365,668 in grants, including a $350,000 NSF grant for Writing for STEM initiatives, allowed me to create embedded support systems that met students in their own disciplinary contexts. These programs succeeded because they were built on pedagogical principles, not technological promises. They addressed real student needs with human connection and disciplinary expertise.

### The Intersection

My work spans writing studies, sound studies, and queer theory not because I'm intellectually scattered, but because I understand how deeply imbricated these areas are. Sound studies teaches us about marginalized voices and embodied knowledge. Queer theory illuminates power structures and the importance of authentic identity. Writing studies shows us how language shapes thought and how thought can reshape the world.

These aren't separate academic interests—they're interconnected ways of understanding how people find their voices, claim their agency, and transform their circumstances. My scholarly work examines these intersections, but my real laboratory is the classroom, where I watch these theories come alive in student transformation.

### The Resistance

My approach to education is intentionally resistant to the neoliberal commodification of higher education. Having worked in Arkansas's right-to-work environment while managing chronic pain, I've experienced firsthand how institutional systems can fail the people they claim to serve. When universities prioritize efficiency over effectiveness, when they treat students as consumers rather than scholars, they reproduce the same power structures that once wrote off kids like me.

I maintain that education is fundamentally about human transformation. This means prioritizing process over product, valuing diverse forms of knowledge, and maintaining high expectations with high support. It means building programs that serve students rather than systems.

### The Personal Stakes

For six years, I lived with constant testicular pain that healthcare systems couldn't or wouldn't adequately address. Managing chronic pain while building innovative educational programs taught me lessons about resilience, about the importance of creating supportive environments, and about the difference between surviving and thriving.

This experience deepened my commitment to inclusive excellence—not lowering standards, but designing multiple pathways to success and recognizing that students' diverse backgrounds and challenges are assets, not deficits. Having lost my job, car, and house due to a combination of inadequate healthcare and systemic failures, I understand intimately what it means to rebuild from nothing.

### The Continuing Journey

Now, in my fifties, I have little patience for performative academics or bureaucratic BS. I've done the hard work of transformation—personal and professional—and I can spot authentic commitment to student learning from a mile away. This intolerance for intellectual dishonesty, combined with deep compassion for students finding their way, shapes my approach to education.

Currently completing a book manuscript that critiques neoliberal influences on higher education while proposing actionable alternatives, I'm particularly interested in how we maintain our commitment to transformative education while navigating new challenges—from AI and digital literacy to increasing political pressures on higher education.

### The Purpose

I teach because I know what it feels like to be written off, and I know what it feels like to be seen and believed in. Every student who walks into my classroom is someone's younger self, looking for direction, for validation, for tools to transform their circumstances. When I meet them where they are, when I honor their experiences while challenging them to think more deeply, I'm paying forward the gift that Pam Hearn gave me decades ago.

This is why I teach: not to fill seats or meet enrollment targets, but to participate in the ongoing work of human transformation, one student, one conversation, one carefully crafted sentence at a time. The journey from margins to transformation isn't just my story—it's the story I help my students write for themselves.

Teaching writing is teaching thinking. Teaching thinking is teaching liberation. And teaching liberation is the most important work I can imagine doing.
